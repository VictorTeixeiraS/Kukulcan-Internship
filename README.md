### **Tasks Completed**  

#### 1. **Research and Familiarization**  
- **RAG Architecture and Applications**  
  - Studied the principles of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its applications in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.  
  - Explored Hugging Face's RAG library and reviewed the paper *"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks"* by Lewis et al.  

- **Multimodal Embeddings**  
  - Researched techniques for representing text and images in a shared embedding space.  
  - Reviewed applications of multimodal embeddings in tasks like image captioning and document analysis.  
  - Studied CLIP and LayoutLM for multimodal tasks.  

- **Processing Unstructured Documents**  
  - Investigated tools such as AWS Textract and Tesseract OCR for extracting text from unstructured data.  
  - Explored pre-trained models for handling documents with mixed modalities.

#### 2. **Graph RAG and Visualization**  
- **Understanding Graph RAG**  
  - Studied the integration of graph structures with RAG to enhance retrieval and knowledge representation.  
  - Explored use cases involving knowledge graphs in question-answering systems.  

- **Integration with LLMs**  
  - Researched how large language models (LLMs) like GPT or BERT can process and interact with graph-based data.  
  - Reviewed frameworks like PyTorch Geometric and DGL for graph modeling.  

- **Visualization Tools (Cytoscape)**  
  - Installed and familiarized with Cytoscape for visualizing and editing graph structures.  
  - Tested basic features for creating and analyzing network graphs.

### **Key Learnings**  
- Gained a deeper understanding of RAG and its ability to combine retrieval mechanisms with generative models for enhanced contextual outputs.  
- Discovered the importance of multimodal embeddings in integrating text and image data.  
- Learned how graph structures and tools like Cytoscape can improve the visualization and understanding of complex relationships in data.
